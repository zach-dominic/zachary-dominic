**Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Zach, a Junior Business Analyst**

Hi, Im Zach, and I am currently studying at TripleTen to enter the Business Analyst field. I have experience with 5 projects in spreadsheets, data visualization and storytelling and slightly in SQL. I am looking forward to my journey into a new career path and learning all the skill that come along

Currently, I am nearing the end of my studies at TripleTen in their Business Analyst program. The curriculum covered Advanced Spreadsheets, Data Visualization and Storytellin with Tableau, a bit of SQL and PowerBI. Along with the teachings were practical projects that were meant to mimic real world projects.

Some facts about me:
 - I enjoy learning new things regardless of the difficulty
 - I've just recently began cooking and enjoy trying to make new things
 - My goal for 2024 is to try and get my foot in the door of BIA/BA in any way I can
